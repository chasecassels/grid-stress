# NYC Grid Stress
---

Exploratory data analysis project to study how grid stress may change across NYC due to temperature variance, climate change, land use changes, population change, and technological improvements.

## Data Ingestion

Ingest Historical NYC Weather Data from the Open Science Foundation API into an empty SQLite database:

```
touch database/weather-data.db
cd file-extraction
bash run_import_processes.sh
```

## To-dos

Data sourcing:

-Source land-use historical data and future data  
-Source population historical and future data
-Source grid use historical data  
-Source annual temperature rise projections  


Preprocessing:  
  
-Create future weather data tables (emulate format of historical data and use averages + projected increases to fill)  
-Temporally downscale population and land use data  
-Write and test Joins/Unions to create one comprehensive historical table and one comprehensive future table with an empty grid use column


ML Research/Testing:

-Research suitable models & mathematical justification (Random Forest / Neural Net / Time Series Models) 
-Write a python script for training on comprehensive historical table (Scikit-learn)  
-Write a script for predicting grid use column values based on training results  


Visualization:

-Grafana?
